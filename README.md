In this project i have done two different exercizes.


First one is dedicated to SingleLinked lists.
According to the assignment, user enter two polynoms from keyboard and the third one will be obtained by the next rule: 
All terms not present in the first polynomial are taken from the second one and included in the third.
Polynom's terms are represented as a singlelinked list.

Second one is dedicated to DoubleLinked lists.
According to the assignment, user enter a string from keyboard. Dot means end of the string. 
Words in the string are represented as a doublelinked list.
In the result, program returns list, where words with even length moved to the end of the list.
